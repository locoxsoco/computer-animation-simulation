![Lab0 Simulation](./images/Lab0.png)

### Integrators DONE
The integrator solvers can be chosen from the comboBox next to each SolverN at the UI and pressing restart.

- Symplectic Euler
- Midpoint
- Verlet
- RK2
- RK4

### Forces DONE
Wind force can be set in the UI as accelerations in each X,Y,Z axis. As for the air resistance, you can choose between no drag, linear drag, and quadratic drag.

- Wind as constant acceleration force
- Linear Drag
- Quadratic Drag

### SceneProjectiles DONE

- Added an additional particle for more testing
- Simple collision to plane with condition y<=0
- Added bouncing and friction coefficients editable in UI
